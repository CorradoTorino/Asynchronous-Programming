# Asynchronous Programming in .NET
Curated resource links I've collected while doing asynchronous programming in .NET. Some of them were very useful to me during my learning path and hopefully, they will help other software developers. Suggestions are welcome.

* [Six Essential Tips for Async by Lucian Wischik (2013)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Three-Essential-Tips-for-Async)  
I usually prefer reading blogs or books rather than watching videos but in this case, they are absolutely worth in order to understand graphically the asynchronous program flow with await/async.

#### Books

#### Samples
I'm currently preparing some small samples for a Meetup and will later on add them to this repository
